# Current Vim Goals

## Annoyed With

- Floating window colors need to change
- Floating windows are stuck in insert mode
- Cannot customize mappings of what formatters to run for what filetypes
  - Applies as well for linters, LSPs, etc
- nvim-tree does not close upon opening a file
- lualine does not show LSP information
- Aerial integration can be improved
  - When I am editing a function:
    - Can I have a hoverview of what variables are in scope for that function?
    - Can I have a hoverview of what globals are accessible for that function?
  - When I am editing a class / struct:
    - Can I have a hoverview of that struct's properties / methods?
- No code action to fill in missing typescript interface members

## Researching

- What are buffers vs. windows vs. tabs vs. sessions?
- What are marks?
- What are macros?

## Experimenting With

- Too much to meaningfully note down at the moment

## Working On

- Making better use of telescope + grep
