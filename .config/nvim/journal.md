# Current Vim Goals

## Diary

Going further with customizing lazyvim

### What do I want?

- Making my Go and cpp tooling better (especially Go which I will be working in)
  - Adding more LSP sources for go files
- AI
  - building my own software dev team?
  - To try:
    - [codecompanion](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim)
    - [aider.nvim](https://github.com/joshuavial/aider.nvim)
    - [parrot](https://github.com/frankroeder/parrot.nvim)
